_notes,"Use either val or source_header, not both.  source_header will look up a value in the current item's row with the same header, while value will just use exactly what is written",,,,,,,,,
_notes,"All types that begin with _ are ignored, so can be used to store variables and used with formulas (vlookup, sum, etc)",,,,,,,,,
_notes,"Any unexpected value (such as a string in posX,posY,width,height or an align other than left,right,center) will instead assume the value is the name of a header to lookup in the current item, just like source_header",,,,,,,,,
_notes,"For example, if canvas width and height depend on the current item, add a column to the other sheet called ""cardwidth"" and ""cardheight"" and then put ""cardwidth"" under canvas width and ""cardheight"" for canvas height",,,,,,,,,
_notes,Width and height fields will scale the item to specific dimensions. Leave blank to avoid scaling.,,,,,,,,,
